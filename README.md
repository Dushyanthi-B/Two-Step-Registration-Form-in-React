# Multi-Step Registration Form

This project is a simple multi-step registration form built with React and Node.js.

## Cloning the Project from GitHub

To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

  git clone https://github.com/Dushyanthi-B/Two-Step-Registration-Form-in-React.git

  cd Two-Step-Registration-Form-in-React


## Project Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies

   Navigate to the project directory and run:

   npm install

2. Environment Variables

   Make sure there is a .env file in the root of the project with the following variable:

   REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-base.com
   
   Replace the URL with your actual backend API base URL


## How to Run the App

1. Start the backend server

   In the project root, run:

   node server.js

   This will start the backend server for API requests.

2. Start the frontend server

   In the same directory, run:

   npm start

   This will start the React development server. The app will open in browser and we can use the registration system from there.

## Assumptions and Decisions

- The backend server is connected and running at the URL specified in the .env file.
- When a user enters an email address that has already been registered, the system will show an error message that the email is already registered.
- The registration form checks all required fields on the client side before allowing the user to continue or submit the form.
- The system is designed to be simple, responsive, and user-friendly, with clear error messages and progress indicators.
